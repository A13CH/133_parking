# 133_Parking

This project is the front-end for a real-time parking spot monitoring system designed for Apartment 133. It uses an MQTT-based communication protocol to detect whether a parking spot is occupied or available and displays the status on a streamlit web application.

## Features

- Real-time updates using MQTT.
- A clean and responsive user interface built with Streamlit.
- Visual indicators (images and text) for parking spot status.

## Deployment
This app is deployed on my Raspberry Pi 5 and can viewed at the url: 103parking.com
